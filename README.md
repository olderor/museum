# museum

Based by playlists, songs, authors it finds different dependencies and music similarity between the data and gives you visualized result, so you can analyze the data.

Additionally, you can upload your own audio file to analyze its melody. Artificial Intelligence will predict the genre of the uploaded song and show you how the melody is changing over time.

Spotify API is used to get information about the songs and playlists. I have used Pushâ€“relabel maximum flow and Minimum cut algorithms to analyze the given data.
